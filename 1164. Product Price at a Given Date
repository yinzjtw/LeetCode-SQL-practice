from products p1
where (p1.product_id, p1.change_date) in (select p2.product_id, max(p2.change_date) 
                    from products p2
                    where p2.change_date <= '2019-08-16'
                    group by p2.product_id
                    order by p2.product_id asc
                    )
UNION
select p3.product_id, 10 as price
from products p3
where p3.product_id in (select p4.product_id from products p4
                        group by p4.product_id 
                        having min(p4.change_date) > '2019-08-16');
