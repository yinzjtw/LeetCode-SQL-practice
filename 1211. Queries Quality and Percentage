This table may have duplicate rows.
This table contains information collected from some queries on a database.
The position column has a value from 1 to 500.
The rating column has a value from 1 to 5. Query with rating less than 3 is a poor query.
 

We define query quality as:
The average of the ratio between query rating and its position.
We also define poor query percentage as:
The percentage of all queries with rating less than 3.

Write a solution to find each query_name, the quality and poor_query_percentage.
Both quality and poor_query_percentage should be rounded to 2 decimal places.
Return the result table in any order.

##### Write MySQL query statement below #####

select query_name,
round((sum(rating/position))/count(query_name),2) as quality,
round(sum(case when rating <3 then 1 else 0 end )/count(*)*100,2) as poor_query_percentage
from Queries
group by query_name
having query_name is not null;
